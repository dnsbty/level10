# Contributing to Level 10

Level 10 is a passion project more than anything. While I intend to keep it
running smoothly and hopefully keep improving it over time, please understand
that it isn't my full-time job.

Issues and pull requests are very welcome. That said, I would recommend opening
an issue first so that we can discuss any features you hope to add before
spending your time on them.

When possible, pull requests should include automated tests to ensure that they
are achieving the desired effect. All new functions should have typespecs and
documentation.

Feel free to open an issue if you see anything that needs clarified in the
documentation as well.
